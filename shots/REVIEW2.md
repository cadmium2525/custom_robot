# HOLOSSEUM — Art Direction Gate Review, Round 2

Reviewing commit `a1fdf34`. Baseline is `shots/REVIEW.md`.

**STATUS: IN PROGRESS.** `PENDING` means not yet verified in this round — it is not a pass.

**VERDICT: PENDING**

---

## How this round was captured

`tools/screenshot.mjs` **did not get the determinism fix.** The seed/freeze work in `a1fdf34`
landed in `measure.mjs` and `contour.mjs` only; `screenshot.mjs`'s `fight` scenario still calls
`startMatch(...)` with no `seed`, and `src/main.js:298` still does
`const matchSeed = seed ?? ((Math.random() * 0xffffffff) >>> 0)`. Two runs of the identical
command five minutes apart (`c3a-fight.png`, `c3b-fight.png`) produced two different fights —
different HP (956/843 vs 980/817), different camera, different arena corner. **Any claim in this
round or any future round that rests on a `screenshot.mjs` fight frame is unrepeatable.**

So this review's fight evidence comes from `tools/cap2.mjs` (written for this pass, in the critic
worktree only, uncommitted): pins `seed=1234567`, sets `engine.paused = true` on the same line
that starts the match, fast-forwards a fixed 420 ticks, then settles the camera rig on a fixed
1/60 delta. Sim state reproduces exactly (`tick=420 p1=-1.93,8.02 p2=9.52,-1.77` every run).
The **rendered** frame still drifts: two runs at that identical sim/camera state differ on
26.1% of pixels by more than 8 levels, max delta 220 — the VFX clock still advances on wall time
during the settle window. Verdict: sim and camera are deterministic, **pixels are not**, unless
VFX are suppressed (which is why `contour.mjs` is stable and `measure.mjs` capture A is not).

Captures referenced: `d1-fight.png` / `d2-fight.png` (cap2, tier 3), `contour-n.png` /
`contour-mask.png` (contour meter, VFX+DOM off), `c3a-title.png`, `c3a-garage.png`.

## Defect ledger

### BLOCKERS

**1. Robots too small to find in the frame.** — **FIXED for the local robot, UNCHANGED for the opponent.**
`contour.mjs` measures the mask directly: ROBOT 1 is **109x209px = 23.2% of frame height**. That
is squarely inside CRV2's 15-25% band and it is a real fix. ROBOT 2 is **47x66px = 7.3%**. The
opponent is still a speck. In a 1v1 game the number that matters is the *smaller* of the two, and
7.3% is less than a third of the local robot. The camera frames the player, not the fight.
*Note:* the rig needs a two-subject framing term — pull back and/or raise until both machines are
above ~12% of frame height, the way CRV2's arena camera did. Framing only the local robot is what
produces the current composition, where the fight happens bottom-centre-left and the right 40% of
the frame is empty deck.

**2. Flat haze, no blacks/whites, no contrast.** — **FIXED.**
`contour-n.png` (VFX and DOM off, so this is the stage's own values) has a genuine range: the
stands read 2-20, the deck 85-110, the cyan rim strips and hazard chevrons clip near 255. There
is true black in the wall band at y≈300-460 and true white on the deck edge highlights. The
uniform blue-grey milk of the previous round is gone. Confirmed by eye at 1:1 and consistent with
the arena rebuild in #12.

**3. Health bars do not communicate health.** — **FIXED.**
`f-hud.png` (1:1 crop of the top 110px of `d1-fight.png`). P1 at 950/1000 shows a solid blue fill
that stops at x≈385 with a hard black remainder to x≈405 — the filled/empty boundary is
unambiguous. ACE at 813/860 mirrors correctly, depleting from the left. The gradient-plus-hatching
mush is gone.
*Residual (new, minor):* P1's bar is blue and P2's is red at full health, so the two are not
comparable at a glance and a healthy opponent reads as "in danger". The Vulcan ammo bar directly
below (`f-gear.png`) is the *same* blue at the *same* weight as the P1 health bar — two different
quantities in identical visual language, 750px apart.

**4. `explosion.png` contains no explosion.** — PENDING

**5. The robots are translucent.** — **FIXED.**
Verified in code and in pixels. `src/gfx/materials.js:112+` builds the shell as an opaque
`MeshStandardMaterial` with an injected rim term; `src/gfx/robot.js:1765` sets
`rimStrength: 0.10, rimPower: 5.2`, i.e. a narrow band, and the strength did **not** creep back up.
At 3x (`t-torso.png`, `g-torso.png`) the chest wedges are painted panels — the background does not
bleed through any plate, and no rear structure is visible through a front one.
*Residual, and it is the same complaint by a different mechanism:* the emissive trim
(`matEmis`, `MeshBasicMaterial` + `toneMapped:false`) draws a bright cyan line along **every**
panel edge, and on the title/garage rig the plates themselves sit at value 15-40 while those lines
sit at 120-180. The machine is therefore a mesh of glowing wires around dark voids. A rim that
describes an edge is right; edge lines brighter than every surface they bound is the hologram
read again. Bring the plate values up (see #24) rather than the lines down.

**6. BOMB/POD cooldown widgets clipped off the bottom.** — **FIXED.**
`f-gear.png`: the VULCAN meter, BOMB/STANDARD and POD/STINGER ring gauges all sit fully inside the
frame with ~20px of bottom margin, labels and kana intact. These are now the best-designed
elements in the HUD.

**7. Shockwave rings read as solid grey donuts.** — PENDING (early read: still typographic — see notes)

**8. Damage flash blows out the opponent HUD plate.** — PENDING

**9. Brand mismatch on the title screen.** — **FIXED.**
`c3a-title.png`: wordmark is **HOLOSSEUM**, sub is ホロシアム, eyebrow is "CUSTOM MACHINE COMBAT
LEAGUE / 機甲競技連盟", corner mark is HLS·02. The product name is now the biggest type on the
screen and the CR·V2 clone-label is gone.

### MAJOR

**10. Beams and tracers have no core and no shape.** — PENDING

**11. Garage stat bars look broken.** — **FIXED.**
`c3a-garage.png` right panel: every bar now has a proportional fill on a dark track (ARMOUR ~95%,
SPEED ~92%, AIR CONTROL ~70%, MASS ~72%, POISE ~55%). The stack order is corrected — label and
numeral on one line, bar beneath. The unexplained "—" now sits under a "VS EQUIPPED" column header,
so it reads as "no change", which is what it always meant.

**12. The arena is a featureless box, not a built place.** — **FIXED.**
`contour-n.png`: raked stands with crowd lights running the full circumference, a black service
wall with louvre panels, a lit entry gate at frame left, an overhead gantry, hazard chevrons on the
deck, cyan rim strips defining the deck edge and every block. It is a built place with a scale
reference. This is the biggest single improvement in the build.

**13. Obstacle blocks are untextured greybox.** — **FIXED.**
Same frame: blocks now carry a panelled top face, a distinct darker side plane, a cyan emissive
rim along the top edge and an orange under-trim at deck level. The lit-top/dark-side discipline
that the robots still lack (#24) is present on the blocks.

**14. Nothing casts a readable shadow.** — **UNCHANGED.**
`contour-n.png` at 1:1: there is no contact shadow under ROBOT 1 at (755-865, 625-835), and no cast
shadow from any of the four obstacle blocks onto the deck, despite `shadows: true` and
`shadowMapSize: 2048` at tier 3. The only darkening is ambient occlusion at block/deck junctions.
The robot reads as a decal on the floor, which is also the reason its feet look like they are not
touching. `g-feet.png` shows the same in the garage — a `contactShadowMaterial` exists
(`robot.js:1562`, opacity 0.7) but nothing of it is visible under the model.
*Note:* find out whether the key light's shadow camera actually contains the play area, or whether
`castShadow` is set on the merged shell meshes at all. A blob shadow alone would recover most of
this, and it is the cheapest available fix for both #14 and #24's grounding problem.

**15. Title and garage robots float on a 1px ellipse in a void.** — **IMPROVED BUT NOT FIXED.**
There is now a real lit pad with a rim ring (`c3a-title.png`, `c3a-garage.png`). Three things stop
it landing: (a) no contact shadow, so the machine still does not touch — see #14; (b) the pad's
outer edge is a hard-edged ellipse against pure black, so it is a disc in a void rather than a
room; (c) **new collision** — in `g-feet.png` the BOMB/POD/LEGS loadout chips are drawn *over the
robot's shins*, at 2x you can see "STANDARD" sitting on the model's left leg.

**16. Right HUD plate flush to screen edge; left plate is not.** — **IMPROVED BUT NOT FIXED.**
`f-hud.png` at 1:1: the ACE plate's top rule is a red hairline at y≈3 that runs to x=1600 with zero
right margin, while P1's top rule is a blue hairline at y≈10 that stops at x≈415. Two plates that
should mirror each other differ in both their y position and whether they bleed. The "stray magenta
hairline" from the last round is that same red rule — it starts at x≈1190, far left of any plate
content, so it still reads as a stray line rather than a frame.

**17. Title screen bottom-left text block is a collision.** — **FIXED.**
"SEASON 02 · BUILD 1.0" now sits alone at (24, 860); the control hints moved to bottom-right. No
element is within 190px of the CONTROLS menu row.

**18. "SELECT ARENA" sub-label is illegible.** — **FIXED.**
`g-cta.png` at 3x: "SELECT ARENA" is near-black on orange (~8:1). The kana アリーナへ is a dark
brown on orange at roughly 3.5:1 — thin, but it resolves at 1:1 and clears the bar for decorative
sub-type.

**19. Garage left rail truncates labels that have room.** — **FIXED.**
Rows 03 and 05 now read "STANDARD" and "FEATHER-X" in full.

**20. Bottom-right debug/telemetry panel ships in every fight frame.** — **FIXED.**
`f-net.png` (2x of the bottom-right 500x120 of `d1-fight.png`) shows deck and nothing else. The
panel is gone from solo play.

**21. The accent colour is doing no work.** — **FIXED.**
`contour-n.png`: orange/yellow hazard chevrons on the deck, an orange under-trim on every obstacle
block, a warm lit gate at frame left, warm crowd lights in the stands, orange BOMB ring in the HUD.
There is a warm note in the 3D scene at three different scales.

**22. Crosshair is invisible.** — **FIXED.**
`d1-fight.png` at (800, 450): a white-cored reticle with an orange ring and four tick marks, with
its own dark outline so it survives over both the bright deck and the dark wall.

**23. Top HUD scrim has a hard banding edge.** — **FIXED.**
`f-hud.png`: the full-width darkening gradient is gone; each plate carries its own dark backing
box. No horizontal seam at y≈100 or anywhere else.

**24. The robot silhouette is mushy.** — **UNCHANGED. This is now the #1 blocker.**
`contour.mjs` on the pinned frame, robots at their real gameplay size:

```
OVERALL   invisible (<12) 72.1%   weak (<25) 89.9%   clean (>=40) 4.1%
ROBOT 1 (109x209px)  invisible 70.0%   body 76.2 vs background 85.5  (separation 9.3)
ROBOT 2 (47x66px)    invisible 78.0%   body  6.7 vs background  2.0  (separation 4.7)
```

Seven tenths of the local robot's outline has a value step under 12 — the outline is not there.
Ninety percent is under 25, which the tool's own rule of thumb calls "survives a still frame,
dissolves in motion". Only 4% reads cleanly.

The mechanism is visible at 1:1 in `contour-n.png` and it is not an edge problem, it is a
**casting** problem: a mid-blue robot is standing on a mid-blue deck (76 vs 86), and the magenta
robot is standing in front of a black wall at value 2 while itself sitting at value 7. Both
machines have been painted the value of the thing behind them. The three-tier panel-tone work from
last round widened the robot's *internal* range without ever asking what it would be seen against.
*Note:* this needs an art decision, not a shader tweak. Either (a) re-value the machines — CRV2 put
saturated, **light** toys on its floor and gave them a hard dark outline, and a light robot on this
deck would separate immediately; or (b) give the deck a much darker mid and keep the robots where
they are; or (c) ship an actual outline pass (inverted hull / depth-discontinuity) so the contour
has a step regardless of what is behind it. Option (c) is the one that matches the reference and
fixes both robots at once. What must stop is tuning the rim: the rim is already at the value where
it makes the machine look like a wireframe (#5) and it has bought 4% clean contour.

### MINOR

**25. Garage swatch row under RAY-01 description is unlabelled.** — **FIXED.** Now headed "LIVERY 塗装".

**26. "EQUIPPED CANDIDATE" legend with no swatches.** — **FIXED.** Both keys now carry swatches.

**27. P1/P2 tabs detached, no selected state.** — **FIXED.** Now 76x40, attached to the rail, P1
carries a filled blue selected state.

**28. Garage bottom bar sits on three different baselines.** — **FIXED.** BACK, the hover hint and
SELECT ARENA all centre on y≈855.

**29. "ROUND 1 / ラウンド" effectively invisible.** — **FIXED.** Now white on its own dark chip at
(735-865, 18-34).

**30. Title selected-row highlight has an unjustified hard cut.** — **FIXED.** The highlight now
fades out to the right instead of terminating on a hard vertical edge.

**31. Title hexagon mark is generic.** — **UNCHANGED.** Still a plain hexagon outline with a small
orange/white bar inside. It carries no read of "arena", "machine" or "holo". Lowest-value item on
this list; fine to leave.

**32. Soft circular flares read as lens dirt.** — PENDING

## New defects and regressions since REVIEW.md

**N1. `tools/screenshot.mjs` is still nondeterministic.** See the capture note at the top. This is
the tool every builder and reviewer reaches for first, and it is the one that did not get fixed.
Passing a fixed `seed` and setting `engine.paused = true` on the `startMatch` line — the same three
lines already in `contour.mjs` — would close it.
*Severity: BLOCKING for the review process itself.*

**N2. Garage loadout chips overlap the model.** `g-feet.png`: the BOMB / POD / LEGS chips are drawn
across the robot's shins. New since the pad landed.

**N3. The two HP bars are not comparable.** See #3 residual — P1 blue, P2 red at identical health
fractions.

**N4. The ammo bar and the health bar are the same widget.** See #3 residual.

**N5. Rendered frames are not reproducible even with a pinned seed and a frozen sim.** 26.1% of
pixels differ by >8 levels between two runs at an identical sim state, because the effect clock
advances on wall time during the settle window. `vfxsheet.mjs` solves this for effects; the fight
capture path does not use it.

## Ranked top-5 blocking the blind side-by-side bar

1. **#24 — the silhouette.** 72% of contour invisible; both machines painted their background's
   value. Nothing else on this list matters as much.
2. **#1 (opponent half) — the opponent is 7.3% of frame height.** You cannot see who you are
   fighting.
3. **#14 — nothing casts a shadow.** The robots are decals on a floor; this is also half of why
   #24 fails.
4. PENDING — VFX (#4/#7/#10/#32), pending the effect sheet.
5. PENDING
